			<p>Humor is infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared, it binds people together and increases happiness. The Laugh is a website that allows you to take a few minutes out of your day and view some of the funnier pictures posted on social media. As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so here is to brightening up your day!</p>
